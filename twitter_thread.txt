Running a @gensynai CodeZero node but confused by the logs? 

What does "Policy Update" mean? How do you know if you're earning rewards?

I wrote a complete guide to decode your logs 👇

First, understand the 3 core log types:

📊 Training Logs → Is your node learning?
🌐 Network Logs → Are you connected to the swarm?
💰 Reward Logs → Are you earning?

Let's break down each one.

TRAINING LOGS: Look for "Policy Update"

Example:
`[INFO] Policy update received (epoch=127, loss=0.0342)`

• epoch = training iteration
• loss = how "wrong" your strategy is

✅ Healthy: loss DECREASING over time
🚩 Red flag: loss stuck for 50+ epochs

Another key metric: "Rollout Generated"

Example:
`[DEBUG] Rollout generated (diversity_score=0.73)`

This is CodeZero's secret sauce! 🔥

diversity_score > 0.6 = you're contributing UNIQUE solutions

This is what makes cooperative learning work.

TWEET 5/10:
NETWORK LOGS: "Difficulty Adjustment"

Example:
`[INFO] Difficulty adjusted: 3 → 4 (swarm_success_rate=0.82)`

Unlike Bitcoin (only goes up), CodeZero adjusts BOTH ways:
• >80% success → harder problems
• <50% success → easier problems

This keeps the swarm learning optimally.

TWEET 6/10:
REWARD LOGS: "Reward Received"

Example:
`[INFO] Reward received (amount=0.0042, rank=3/12)`

Your rank matters! CodeZero uses GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization)

Even if correct, you earn less if others found better solutions.

It's cooperative, not just competitive.

TWEET 7/10:
How rewards are calculated:

Final Reward = 
(correctness × 0.5) + 
(efficiency × 0.25) + 
(novelty × 0.25)

Example:
(0.95 × 0.5) + (0.78 × 0.25) + (0.82 × 0.25) = 0.875

High novelty = higher rewards! 💡

TWEET 8/10:
🚩 WARNING PATTERNS:

"The Reward Drought"
→ Solutions submitted but no rewards
→ Check your correctness scores

"The Diversity Collapse"
→ diversity_score dropping fast
→ You're becoming too similar to others

---

TWEET 9/10:
✅ HEALTHY NODE SESSION:

• Policy updates every ~5 min
• Consistent rewards (rank 2-4/10)
• Decreasing loss over time
• diversity_score > 0.5

If you see these, you're doing it right! 🎯
