# Content Roadmap: "Cooperative AI"

Capture the team's attention by translating their complex "Cooperative AI" concepts into accessible content.

## Piece 1: The "Apes Together Strong" Thread (Twitter/X)
**Hook:** "Why Gensyn's CodeZero is the end of PvP DePIN and the start of Co-op AI."
**Key Points:**
- Explain **GRPO** simply (Group Relative Policy Optimization = "We learn faster if we share notes").
- Contrast with Bitcoin/Solana (Competition) vs. CodeZero (Cooperation).
- **Visual:** A meme of a single robot failing vs. a swarm of robots building a tower.

## Piece 2: Technical Guide: "Inside the Mind of a Solver" (Blog/Discord Guide)
**Title:** "How to read your CodeZero logs: Are you actually learning?"
**Content:**
- A breakdown of the log messages.
- What does a "Policy Update" look like?
- How do you know if you received a "Reward"?
**Value:** High utility for confused newbies.

## Piece 3: The "Evaluator" Deep Dive (Infographic)
**Concept:** A visual diagram showing how the Evaluator (Frozen Qwen 3) judges code without running it.
**Why:** This is a novel technical innovation (LLM-based evaluation). Explaining it shows deep technical understanding.
