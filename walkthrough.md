# Walkthrough - Gensyn Rover Strategy (CodeZero Edition)

I have updated the strategy documents to align with the specific "CodeZero" cooperative mechanics and the user's request for general dApp ideas.

## Accomplishments
- **Refined Project Ideas**: Replaced generic ideas with "Swarm Pulse", "Proposer Proxy", and "Rollout Diversity" tools.
- **Added General dApps**: Brainstormed and added ideas for a "Model Marketplace", "Compute Bounties", and "Verifiable Moderation" to leverage the broader Gensyn protocol.
- **Updated Node Strategy**: Switched recommendation to "The Marathon Runner" (24/7 uptime) to maximize GRPO learning.
- **New Content Roadmap**: Outlined "Apes Together Strong" and technical deep dives into Solvers/Evaluators.

## Artifacts Updated
- [project_ideas.md](file:///c:/Users/PC/ANTigravity%20Gensyn/project_ideas.md) (Added CodeZero tools + General dApps)
- [node_strategy_analysis.md](file:///c:/Users/PC/ANTigravity%20Gensyn/node_strategy_analysis.md) (Updated to "Marathon Runner")
- [content_outline.md](file:///c:/Users/PC/ANTigravity%20Gensyn/content_outline.md) (Updated with Cooperative AI themes)

## Verification Results
- **Strategy Alignment**: The documents now directly address the "Cooperative" nature of CodeZero (GRPO, Rollout Sharing).
- **User Request Met**: The "General Gensyn dApp" requirement is fulfilled in `project_ideas.md`.
